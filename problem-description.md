# Pantry
Pantry is a mobile Android application that allows a user to create a grocery list from a a prepopulated total list.

### Problem Description
The problem we saw was how to help encourage students to eating healthier than before. If they are not eating healthy they cannot be productive and by doing grocery lists, they can truly manage their budget along with it as well. The Android app is in its early stages, however, the focus of the app is to create an ease for the users to be able to frequently check what it is available in their "pantry" at any one time and know when they should go about getting new items due to expiration dates. Though not everything we initially wanted to incorporate in the app is not quite implemented, we still find that this will allow our users to have a wonderful and easy experience.

### Experience
The user will be able to go through the total list by common food categories and will see the top first three items in the dataset on the cards, if the item they see is not on the front, they can expand into the particular category by use of the "More Items" button. It will show the entire list that we have populated with information.

### Future Features
* User Login
  * Allowing for sharing grocery lists across users
  * Group lists for housemates/roommates
* Adding new items that are not on the database for the users
* Adding price values for items to keep track of pricings and expenditures
  * Possibly using a library for deciphering receipt images
* Adding the Pantry view
  * Adding expiration dates to the pantry
